Carbohydrates and calories are not listed on pet food cans but carbohydrates are usually the cause of obesity in cats and dogs.\\n\\nThis handy free app lets you easily determine the carbohydrates and calories for a particular cat or dog food on your Android smart phone. I developed this free calculator app for my guests at CatNews.org and it has no advertising. \\n\\nCan carbohydrates cause health problems?\\nFeeding your pet the right diet is crucial, especially if they're suffering with a health issue like diabetes or cancer.\\n\\nCarbohydrates can occasionally cause medical problems including obesity in dogs and cats. Obesity occurs when your pet's energy needs are exceeded and the extra glucose created by the digestion of the carbohydrates is stored as fat. Realize that an excess of carbohydrates, fats, or proteins can all lead to obesity, but carbohydrates are usually the cause since they are typically the most common energy source and are easily converted to glucose\\n\\nCats and dogs are among the most popular pets in the world - both of these animals need the right care, attention but most importantly, the right diet. \\n\\nCatNews.org has developed this app to help owners of overwieght pets or pets with health conditions - carbohydrates and calories are not listed on pet food cans. Our app calculates the number of carbohydrates and calories in a can of cat or dog food.\\n\\nEven with a medical condition, every pet owner wants their pet to have a long, healthy and happy life. Bad diet can shorten the life span of your pet, especially when they are vulnerable with these illnesses. With this app, you can keep your cat or dog healthy for the duration of their lives. \\n\\nMany pet owners don't realise how important calories and carbohydrates are for the development and welfare of their cat or dog. If health problems  are detected, everything must be in-place to ensure that your pet will be aided in their recovery.\\n\\nThis application is not only for pets with diabetes or cancer - it can also be used to aid weight-loss among overweight pets. Having an overweight pet may not be beneficial to its health in the long term and it is therefore important to make sure your cat/dog is healthy and eating it's recommended intake of calories and not exceeding it. \\n\\nSo, what are you waiting for? Give your pet the health and life it deserves, download our Pet food Carbohydrate and Calorie calculator today and then visit CatNews.org\\n\\nContent rating: Everyone",

	"description":"Blackjack or Twenty One is a common casino card game whose goal is to get your hand’s value as close as possible to 21 without exceeding it.  This implementation of the game allows you to surrender you hand and lose half your original bet provided that the dealer doesn’t have a natural blackjack.  Doubling your original bet is also allowed.  The option to buy insurance if the dealer’s up card is an ace is also available.  When insurance is used you must bet half of your original bet.  You may also split a pair into two hands however re-splitting is not allowed.  Insurance, splitting or doubling is not allowed if you don’t have enough cash to cover the new bet.  You may add more cash to your total before a round starts by selecting the “add more cash” button from the menu.  This game is for entertainment purposes only and does not use any form of real money.  This game can be played with 1 or 6 decks.  When you play with 1 deck, blackjack pays 1.2 times your original bet.  If you play with 6 decks blackjack pays 1.5 times your original bet.  Blackjack pays less when you are playing with 1 deck in order to counter the advantage a player may achieve by keeping track of the card that have already been played.  This type of adjustment is common in real blackjack games. This game is designed to simulate a real deck or shoe of card and the odds should be similar to using actual cards even though it may not seem like it.\\n\\nContent rating: Medium Maturity",

Cards are laid out in a grid face down, and players take turns flipping pairs of cards over.  If the two cards match, the player scores one point, the two cards are removed from the game, and the player gets another turn. If they do not match, the cards are turned back over.\\n\\nThe object is to match pairs of cards in as little moves as possible. When cards are turned over, it is important to remember where they are for when the matching card is turned up later in the game.\\n\\nMatch Up will allow you to challenge your memory.
